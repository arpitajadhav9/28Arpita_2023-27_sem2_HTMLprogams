                    1. Flower morphology consists of two main parts: the vegetative part, including non-reproductive structures like petals, and the reproductive or sexual parts.<br>
                    2. A typical flower is composed of four structures attached to a short stalk called the receptacle.<br>
                    3. Floral organs are arranged in a spiral fashion, forming four main whorls from the base upwards: calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium.<br>
                    4. The calyx and corolla together constitute the non-reproductive portion called the perianth; in some cases, they may not be distinguishable and are referred to as tepals.<br>
